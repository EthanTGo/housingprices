# Housing Prices Project

The Housing project is a project that aims to implement different statistical analysis such as ANOVA, ANCOVA and paired test to gain more insights with the data. Using R, I looked at the different visualization and analytical technique I can use to understand a dataset. 

# Motivation

The motivation behind the project is to apply a lot of the new skills that I learned in my statistic class into practice. Looking at the different statistics will allow me to understand the data a lot more. 

# File Description

The file is set up all witihin a folder. The main file to look at is the Project.Rmd file. This file is the R notebook that contains code and explanation. The Project.R is a file that was primarily used to experiment with the different functions.
